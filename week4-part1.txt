Assume one of my friends wants to open an entertainment business in Las Vegas.
Then, he might need some advice about "what business to open" and "where to set up the business".
Las Vegas is a crowded city of both population and business, and there exists a high variation of entertainments arounds the city.
My friend tries to find the best location to maximize the profit for the choice of business.
Also, if the profit is hard to evaluate, my friend wants to at least maximize the revenue.
